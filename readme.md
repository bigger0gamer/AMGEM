Description
===========

Welcome to AMGEM~!! This program allows you to edit and manage your Among Us host options.

 - Store your favorite custom game rules on hand as "gametypes" to quickly switch between custom games!
 - Edit your host game rules, including rich options not normally available for selection in game!
   - Extremely fast/slow player speeds!
   - Extremely high/low player vision!
   - Extremley slow/fast kill cooldown, even bypassing the initial 10 second kill cooldown!
   - Have an absurd amount of tasks!
   - Make voting phases end instantly! (No ejects ever)
   - Infinite voting time!
   - A never before seen Sentinel Beams on map weapon set!
   - And even 
   - And probably more I didn't think to put in this description!

I used my previous program [H2GEM](https://github.com/bigger0gamer/H2GEM) as a basis for this program.

Usage
=====

This program requires the Java Runtime Environment 11 or higher to run. To run, simply use `java AMGEM` in the AMGEM directory. Windows users can just double click on `run.bat` instead (you may not see the file extension). A command prompt window will appear with the program in it. This program runs entirely in the command line, as I was too lazy to bother with a GUI. To select options, just enter the number or letter corresponding to the desired option into the terminal, and hit enter. 

You can use the arguments "-ap" to send the absolute path of your Among Us save data folder (the one containing the gameHostOptions), if it isn't in the default location or you're not using Windows. Otherwise, AMGEM assumes the save data folder is in its default location.

I'd like to make a special thanks to Dabestbro on Steam and everyone who helped them document the gameHostOptions file, as I used their information as the basis of this program, and I'm sure it took much longer for them to document that file than it did for me to make this!
